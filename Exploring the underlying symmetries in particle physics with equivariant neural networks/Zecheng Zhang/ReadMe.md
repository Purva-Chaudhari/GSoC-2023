Tasks: https://github.com/Zhang-Zecheng/test

"Since I am super busy these days and don't have much time to tune the hyperparameters, and it takes a huge amount of time to train the model, the model for task2 and equivariant neural network might be a little overfit. But we can still see that an equivariant neural network has better learning ability. 

I enjoy the time spent on playing with deep learning models for natural science and would like to devote my time writing proposals and contributing to the community. "
